## About The Project

**Echoes of the Void** is a first-person psychological and survival horror game concept, planned for development in Unity 3D. The project aims to deliver a deeply unsettling and terrifying experience by focusing on atmosphere, psychological deterioration, and cosmic dread, rather than relying on jump scares.

Players will navigate the reality-distorting Blackwood Manor, searching for a lost loved one while confronting the disturbing manifestations of "The Void" â€“ an incomprehensible dimension slowly bleeding into our reality.

This is a personal project designed to explore and plan advanced ideas in game design, particularly within the horror genre, and to demonstrate detailed narrative planning capabilities.

## Core Features (Concept)

* **Immersive Psychological Horror:** Emphasizes dread, paranoia, and the slow unraveling of the protagonist's sanity.
* **Dynamic Sanity System:** Visual and auditory hallucinations intensify as the player's sanity diminishes.
* **Environmental Storytelling:** Uncover the manor's dark history and the truth of "The Void" through cryptic notes, journals, and hidden objects.
* **Reality-Distorting Environments:** Blackwood Manor itself actively shifts and distorts, challenging player navigation and sense of security.
* **Stealth-Based Gameplay:** No combat; players must hide, evade, and use their environment to survive the malevolent entities.
* **Resource Management:** Limited flashlight battery and sound recorder charge add to the tension.
* **Interactive Sound Design:** Utilize a specialized sound recorder to detect clues and expose hidden phenomena.
* **Ambiguous Narrative:** A story designed to leave players with a lasting sense of unease and questions about reality.
