## üìú Overview of the Development Process

This directory serves as a living development log (DevLog) for "Echoes of the Void." It documents the conceptualization, design decisions, iterative processes, and challenges faced during the game's creation. The goal is to provide transparency into the "behind-the-scenes" work, showcasing design thinking, problem-solving, and artistic evolution.

## üìÇ Process Categories & Contents

This folder is organized to reflect different aspects of the game's development journey:

* **`GDD_Docs/` (Game Design Document & Narrative):**
    * Contains conceptual documents, narrative outlines, lore expansions, and detailed design specifications for game mechanics.
    * Example files: `Initial_Concept_Doc.md`, `Game_Design_Document_Outline.md`, `Mechanics_Breakdown.md`, `Lore_Expansions.md`.
* **`AI_Narrative_Prompts/`:**
    * Text files or screenshots of prompts given to AI tools (e.g., NovelAI) to generate narrative content, dialogue, or lore.
    * Demonstrates prompt engineering skills.

    * Raw output from AI tools based on the provided prompts.
    * Shows the initial "raw material" provided by the AI before refinement.
* **`AI_Content_Refinements/`:**
    * Edited and refined versions of the AI-generated content, showcasing the human iteration and polish applied.
    * Highlights the creative input and decision-making beyond AI generation.
* **`Concept_Art/`:**
