# ü§ñ Character Prompts for "Echoes of the Void" üé®

This document details the specific Meshy AI prompts used for generating 3D models and textures for the key characters and entities within the "Echoes of the Void" game project. These prompts are crafted to align with the game's psychological horror and survival themes, aiming for unsettling and immersive visual elements.

## üßç Player Character: Liam Vance (The Protagonist)

**Note:** Based on the user's provided models, `ImageModel3.png` is identified as the protagonist model, Liam Vance. The previous section's prompt for "Elias Thorne" visually matches this model. Therefore, this section defines the visual for Liam, the player character. Elias Thorne, as the previous investigator, will be a background character, likely encountered through his journals, recordings, or as a static model (e.g., a body) at a later point, potentially reusing this model in a non-animated/static state.

### Model Prompt: Liam Vance (Protagonist)
"3D model of a lean, middle-aged male, gaunt face, sunken eyes, disheveled short hair, wearing torn and dirty researcher's clothes: an unbuttoned lab coat over a stained shirt, tattered trousers. Emphasize realistic, slightly exaggerated gaunt features for horror. Dynamic pose (e.g., holding a flashlight, looking around nervously) suitable for a playable character."

### Texture Prompt: Liam Vance (Protagonist)
"PBR textures for Liam Vance model: pale, sallow skin with prominent dark circles under eyes, visible stress lines, and a faint sickly sheen. Lab coat should be off-white with extensive grime, dried stains (rust, unknown liquids), and fraying edges. Shirt and trousers in desaturated, faded blues and browns, with realistic fabric tears, dirt smudges, and subtle bloodstains. Hair should be patchy and dull grey-brown. Emphasize weary and unkempt appearance from prolonged distress."

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Previous Investigator: Elias Thorne

Elias Thorne is the seasoned paranormal investigator who ventured into Blackwood Manor before Liam. His appearance, if encountered as a static element (e.g., a body), should reflect the horrific toll the manor took on him.

**Note:** As established, the existing `ImageModel3.png` model (used for Liam Vance as the player character) could be potentially reused here for a static representation of Elias Thorne, emphasizing his shared professional background and the similar fate that awaits those who delve too deep. This prompt focuses on the *state* he would be in if found.

### Model Prompt: Elias Thorne (Static/Deceased)
"3D model of a male figure, appearing deceased or incapacitated, sprawled on the ground or slumped against an object. Body should be emaciated, clothes torn and stained, showing signs of extreme distress and decay. Face should be contorted in a final expression of horror or despair. Pose is static, emphasizing a tragic end."

### Texture Prompt: Elias Thorne (Static/Deceased)
"PBR textures for Elias Thorne (static model): Skin severely pale, almost grey, with prominent veins and bruising. Clothes (lab coat, shirt, trousers) heavily soiled with dark, dried stains (blood, grime, unknown substances) and significant tearing. Fabric should appear brittle and saturated with dampness. Hair matted and lifeless. Overall textures should convey advanced decay, prolonged suffering, and absolute finality."

## üëª Main Entity: The Void Echo

The Void Echo is not a traditional monster, but a manifestation of cosmic dread ‚Äì a shifting, ambiguous entity that hints at a human form but is fundamentally distorted and unsettling. This directly refers to `ImageModel2.png`.

### Model Prompt: The Void Echo
"Abstract, amorphous 3D entity, vaguely humanoid but heavily distorted. Composed of shifting, dark, smoky tendrils and geometric anomalies. Parts of the form should appear to dissolve and reform. No distinct face, just a suggestion of eyes or a void where the face should be. Translucent elements. Static, unsettling pose. **This model aligns with the 'ImageModel2.png' reference, emphasizing its elongated, decaying, and semi-liquid appearance.**"

### Texture Prompt: The Void Echo
"Ethereal, dark, and semi-transparent PBR textures for The Void Echo model. The primary body should be a pale, almost bleached, decaying flesh tone, with visible sinews and skeletal hints. The surrounding matter should be composed of deep cosmic purples, blues, and blacks, with glowing, unsettling veins of dark energy and faint, shifting patterns. Texture should convey a sense of a collapsing void, disintegration, and a grotesque, ethereal presence. **Textures should further enhance the unsettling organic decay and gaseous distortions seen in 'ImageModel2.png'.**"

## üßü Secondary Entity: The Whispering Shade

A more grounded, but still terrifying, entity ‚Äì perhaps a tormented spirit or a distorted memory given form, often appearing as a psychological manifestation. This directly refers to `ImageModel.png`.

### Model Prompt: The Whispering Shade
"3D model of a gaunt, emaciated humanoid figure, gender ambiguous, cloaked in ragged, dark fabric. Limbs are elongated and jointed unnaturally. Head is obscured by shadow or a tattered hood, with only a suggestion of glowing, malevolent eyes. Ethereal, decaying look. Static pose, slightly slumped. **This model aligns with the 'ImageModel.png' reference, focusing on its skeletal form wrapped in tattered cloth with a menacing hood.**"

### Texture Prompt: The Whispering Shade
"Muted, decaying PBR textures for The Whispering Shade model. The skeletal structure should be prominent, with bones appearing aged and brittle, possibly stained. The ragged cloak should be dark, desaturated greys and browns, appearing as old, worn burlap or rotted wool, with visible tears, dust, and damp stains. Skin (where visible) should be sickly pale, almost translucent. Eyes should be sunken, with a faint, sickly yellow or greenish glow that pulses subtly. Overall texture should convey extreme decay and lingering misery. **Textures should enhance the aged, brittle appearance of the bones and the decaying, absorbent quality of the dark cloak, consistent with 'ImageModel.png'.**"

## üëß Illusory Manifestation: Alice (The Child)

This character appears as a fragmented memory or illusion, her appearance subtly unsettling or incomplete, directly using the `unnamed (3).png` model. She is a manifestation of the manor's past tragedies and the Void's influence.

### Model Prompt: The Child (Illusory)
"3D model of a young girl, approximately 7-8 years old, wearing a simple, old-fashioned dress. Her form should be slightly translucent or fragmented, with parts of her body subtly flickering or missing. Hair is long and tangled. Eyes are large and vacant, not fully rendered. Static, ethereal pose. **This model directly uses the 'unnamed (3).png' reference, emphasizing her spectral, almost broken appearance.**"

### Texture Prompt: The Child (Illusory)
"Desaturated, faded PBR textures for The Child model. Dress should be a pale, dusty white, appearing aged and slightly transparent, as if seen through a veil. Skin is ghostly pale, almost ethereal, with faint, subtle blemishes and hints of translucency. Hair should have a soft, faded brown quality, like an old photograph, with some strands appearing to pixelate or dissolve at the edges. Textures should convey a sense of a decaying memory, with subtle visual noise or static-like patterns that hint at disintegration. **Textures should faithfully reproduce the faded, ghostly quality of the 'unnamed (3).png' image, highlighting the visual distortion.**"
