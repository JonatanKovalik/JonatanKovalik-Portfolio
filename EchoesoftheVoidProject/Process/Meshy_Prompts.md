## üßç Protagonist: Elias Thorne

Elias is a middle-aged, disheveled researcher. His appearance should reflect exhaustion, paranoia, and the toll the manor is taking on him.

### Model Prompt: Elias Thorne
"3D model of a lean, middle-aged male, gaunt face, sunken eyes, disheveled short hair, wearing torn and dirty researcher's clothes: an unbuttoned lab coat over a stained shirt, tattered trousers. Emphasize realistic, slightly exaggerated gaunt features for horror. No aggressive stance. Static pose."

### Texture Prompt: Elias Thorne
"PBR textures for Elias Thorne model: pale, sallow skin with prominent dark circles under eyes, visible stress lines, and a faint sickly sheen. Lab coat should be off-white with extensive grime, dried stains (rust, unknown liquids), and fraying edges. Shirt and trousers in desaturated, faded blues and browns, with realistic fabric tears, dirt smudges, and subtle bloodstains. Hair should be patchy and dull grey-brown. Emphasize weary and unkempt appearance from prolonged distress."

## üëª Main Antagonist: The Void Echo

The Void Echo is not a traditional monster, but a manifestation of cosmic dread ‚Äì a shifting, ambiguous entity that hints at a human form but is fundamentally distorted and unsettling.

### Model Prompt: The Void Echo
"Abstract, amorphous 3D entity, vaguely humanoid but heavily distorted. Composed of shifting, dark, smoky tendrils and geometric anomalies. Parts of the form should appear to dissolve and reform. No distinct face, just a suggestion of eyes or a void where the face should be. Translucent elements. Static, unsettling pose."

### Texture Prompt: The Void Echo
"Ethereal, dark, and semi-transparent PBR textures for The Void Echo model. The primary body should be a pale, almost bleached, decaying flesh tone, with visible sinews and skeletal hints. The surrounding matter should be composed of deep cosmic purples, blues, and blacks, with glowing, unsettling veins of dark energy and faint, shifting patterns. Texture should convey a sense of a collapsing void, disintegration, and a grotesque, ethereal presence."

## üßü Minor Entity: The Whispering Shade

A more grounded, but still terrifying, entity ‚Äì perhaps a tormented spirit or a distorted memory given form.

### Model Prompt: The Whispering Shade
"3D model of a gaunt, emaciated humanoid figure, gender ambiguous, cloaked in ragged, dark fabric. Limbs are elongated and jointed unnaturally. Head is obscured by shadow or a tattered hood, with only a suggestion of glowing, malevolent eyes. Ethereal, decaying look. Static pose, slightly slumped."

### Texture Prompt: The Whispering Shade
"Muted, decaying PBR textures for The Whispering Shade model. The skeletal structure should be prominent, with bones appearing aged and brittle, possibly stained. The ragged cloak should be dark, desaturated greys and browns, appearing as old, worn burlap or rotted wool, with visible tears, dust, and damp stains. Skin (where visible) should be sickly pale, almost translucent. Eyes should be sunken, with a faint, sickly yellow or greenish glow that pulses subtly. Overall texture should convey extreme decay and lingering misery."

## üëß Companion Character (Memory/Illusion): Lily (Elias's daughter)

Lily appears as a fragmented memory or illusion, her appearance subtly unsettling or incomplete.

### Model Prompt: Lily (Illusion)
"3D model of a young girl, approximately 7-8 years old, wearing a simple, old-fashioned dress. Her form should be slightly translucent or fragmented, with parts of her body subtly flickering or missing. Hair is long and tangled. Eyes are large and vacant, not fully rendered. Static, ethereal pose."

### Texture Prompt: Lily (Illusion)
"Desaturated, faded PBR textures for Lily's model. Dress should be a pale, dusty white, appearing aged and slightly transparent, as if seen through a veil. Skin is ghostly pale, almost ethereal, with faint, subtle blemishes and hints of translucency. Hair should have a soft, faded brown quality, like an old photograph, with some strands appearing to pixelate or dissolve at the edges. Textures should convey a sense of a decaying memory, with subtle visual noise or static-like patterns that hint at disintegration."
