# ü§ñ Meshy AI Character Prompts for "Echoes of the Void" üé®

This document details the specific Meshy AI prompts used for generating 3D models, textures, and animations for the key characters and entities within the "Echoes of the Void" game project. These prompts are crafted to align with the game's psychological horror and survival themes, aiming for unsettling and immersive visual elements.

## üßç Protagonist: Elias Thorne

Elias is a middle-aged, disheveled researcher. His appearance should reflect exhaustion, paranoia, and the toll the manor is taking on him. His animations focus on subtle fear, resourcefulness, and vulnerability.

### Model Prompt: Elias Thorne
"3D model of a lean, middle-aged male, gaunt face, sunken eyes, disheveled short hair, wearing torn and dirty researcher's clothes: an unbuttoned lab coat over a stained shirt, tattered trousers. Emphasize realistic, slightly exaggerated gaunt features for horror. No aggressive stance. Static pose."

### Texture Prompt: Elias Thorne
"Realistic PBR textures for Elias Thorne model: pale, clammy skin with visible dark circles under eyes and subtle veins. Lab coat texture should be off-white, stained with grime and dried liquids. Shirt and trousers in muted, desaturated tones (grey/brown) with realistic fabric tears and dirt. Focus on griminess and wear."

### Animation Prompt: Elias Thorne
"Subtle idle animation for Elias Thorne: slight trembling, head occasionally darting, nervous fidgeting with hands, shallow breathing. Followed by a slow, cautious walk cycle, hunched posture, frequently glancing over shoulder. Also a quick, panicked sprint and a crouched stealth walk."

## üëª Main Antagonist: The Void Echo

The Void Echo is not a traditional monster, but a manifestation of cosmic dread ‚Äì a shifting, ambiguous entity that hints at a human form but is fundamentally distorted and unsettling. Its animations should be fluid, unnatural, and unsettling, never fully resolving into a clear shape.

### Model Prompt: The Void Echo
"Abstract, amorphous 3D entity, vaguely humanoid but heavily distorted. Composed of shifting, dark, smoky tendrils and geometric anomalies. Parts of the form should appear to dissolve and reform. No distinct face, just a suggestion of eyes or a void where the face should be. Translucent elements. Static, unsettling pose."

### Texture Prompt: The Void Echo
"Ethereal, dark, and semi-transparent PBR textures for The Void Echo model. Combine deep purples, blues, and blacks with subtle, shifting glimmers of dark matter. Texture should convey a sense of cosmic energy, void, and disintegration, with faint, unsettling patterns that don't quite resolve."

### Animation Prompt: The Void Echo
"Disturbing, non-locomotive animation for The Void Echo: slow, undulating shifts of its form, tendrils subtly expanding and contracting, flickering in and out of existence. Include moments of rapid, jerky movements that defy physics, then return to slow, deliberate distortion. No walking or running; it glides or warps."

## üßü Minor Entity: The Whispering Shade

A more grounded, but still terrifying, entity ‚Äì perhaps a tormented spirit or a distorted memory given form. Its movements are slow, deliberate, and creepy, suggesting immense pain or suffering.

### Model Prompt: The Whispering Shade
"3D model of a gaunt, emaciated humanoid figure, gender ambiguous, cloaked in ragged, dark fabric. Limbs are elongated and jointed unnaturally. Head is obscured by shadow or a tattered hood, with only a suggestion of glowing, malevolent eyes. Ethereal, decaying look. Static pose, slightly slumped."

### Texture Prompt: The Whispering Shade
"Muted, decaying PBR textures for The Whispering Shade: torn, heavy fabric (like burlap or old wool) in dark, desaturated greys and browns. Textures should show decay, dust, and possibly faint traces of dried blood or moisture. Skin (if visible) should be sickly pale, almost translucent. Eyes emit a faint, sickly yellow glow."

### Animation Prompt: The Whispering Shade
"Slow, dragging walk cycle for The Whispering Shade: limbs appear heavy, dragging along the ground. Include an unsettling idle animation where its head subtly tilts, as if listening intently, and its body sways slightly. A sudden, short, lunging attack animation, followed by a slow retreat. No quick movements."

## üëß Companion Character (Memory/Illusion): Lily (Elias's daughter)

Lily appears as a fragmented memory or illusion, her appearance subtly unsettling or incomplete. Her animations should be childlike but with an underlying strangeness, reflecting Elias's perception.

### Model Prompt: Lily (Illusion)
"3D model of a young girl, approximately 7-8 years old, wearing a simple, old-fashioned dress. Her form should be slightly translucent or fragmented, with parts of her body subtly flickering or missing. Hair is long and tangled. Eyes are large and vacant, not fully rendered. Static, ethereal pose."

### Texture Prompt: Lily (Illusion)
"Desaturated, faded PBR textures for Lily's dress and skin. Dress should be a pale, dusty blue with signs of age and distress. Skin is ghostly pale, almost translucent, with faint, almost invisible veins. Textures should suggest a faded photograph or a decaying memory, with subtle visual noise/grain."

### Animation Prompt: Lily (Illusion)
"Childlike, yet unsettling, walk cycle for Lily: slightly wavering, as if unstable. Idle animation includes subtle swaying, an occasional slow blink, and a gentle, almost imperceptible turn of the head. A "disappear" animation where she slowly fades into shimmering particles. No aggressive or panicked animations."
